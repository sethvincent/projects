## About

I work on a lot of different projects. They are all in different stages and it can be hard to keep track of them.

This repo documents the projects that I work on in my free time.

## Overall goal

My goal is to create tools for journalism, community organizing, music, and games.

## Documentation tools

I'm spending as much time as I can on documentation. Here are some documentation-focused tools I've been working on:

- [devo](https://npmjs.com/devo) â€“ a command-line tool for creating files like README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, code of conduct, and other repetitive code maintenance tasks.
- [docpage.org](https://docpage.org) â€“ create documentation sites from a single markdown file
- [markdown-reader](https://npmjs.com/markdown-reader) â€“Â create a stream of markdown files
- [rewrite-markdown-urls](https://npm/rewrite-markdown-urls) â€“Â turn relative github urls into urls appropriate for a static site
- [minidocs](https://npmjs.com/minidocs) â€“ build a simple site for your documentation
